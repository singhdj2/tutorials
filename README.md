# Tutorials
This repository contains short tutorials on data wrangling and modeling. I wrote some of these tutorials to present in the K-State Plant Breeding and Genetics journal's coding sessions.  In future, I intend to add more R and Python tutorials. My ultimate goal is to make the user familiar with analysis workflows related to plant breeding, genetics and high-throughput phenotyping area. Check out the *output* and *data* directories above for the tutorial files. Also, check this page regularly for upcoming tutorials.

# Summarizing Temporal HTP Data (Summer 2019) 
(Updated: Aug 8, 2019)
This tutorial goes through the steps to analyze digital drone-based height measurements. These measurements have a temporal component that makes it a perfect use-case for non-linear regression modeling. Along the way, I also discuss some exploratory data analysis methods. An instruction manual is provided to get you started (*refer to* **code/instructions-tutorial-summary-htp-log-regr.pdf**). A markdown summary of the complete analysis can also be found in the same directory (*filename* **tutorial-summary-htp-log-regr.pdf**).
