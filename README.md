# Tutorials
This repository contains short tutorials on data wrangling and modeling. I wrote some of these tutorials with the intention of presenting them in K-State Plant Breeding and Genetics journal's coding sessions this summer.  I intend to add more R and Python tutorials in coming days. My ultimate goal is to make the user familiar with analysis workflows related to plant breeding, genetics and high-throughput phenotyping area. Stay tuned for more tutorials....
